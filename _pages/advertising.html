      <h1 class="title">Peer-To-Peer Trust</h1>
      <p>When celebrities or influencers share products they are perceived as paid advertisement placements and have lower engagement rates due to trust issues.</p>
      <p><strong>When you go through us, every one of our fans view our posts as trustworthy and important. This means higher engagement rates, higher conversions, and higher organic sharing.</strong></p>

      <h1 class="title">Organic Sharing</h1>
      <p>We have one of the highest rate of organic sharing that you will find. <strong>Our network reaches over 50 million people a month, and generates over 10 million organic engagements (likes, favs, comments, reblogs)</strong>.</p>

      <h1 class="title">Native Content</h1>
      <p>Our content matches the aesthetic and language of the most shared content on Tumblr, and gets the best results.</p>
      <p>Because, we follow the same practice as everyone else your sponsored post can't be blocked by adblocking technology, which means everyone can see the content on desktop and on mobile. Without worrying about not being seen.</p>

      <p class="quote">
        "The average post on Tumblr is reblogged 14 times, but the average sponsored post on Tumblr is reblogged 10,000 times."
        <span> &mdash;  Marissa Mayer (CEO of Yahoo, parent company of Tumblr)</span>
