A benefit agency (or corporation) is a new class of company that voluntarily meets different standards of purpose, accountability, and transparency.  

We must:

> 1) Have a corporate purpose to create a material positive impact on society and the environment.

> 2) Consider the impact of their decisions not only on shareholders but also on workers, community, and the environment.

> 3) Make available to the public, an annual benefit report that assesses their overall social and environmental performance against a third party standard.
