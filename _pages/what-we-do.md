<p>We are a public benefit agency, which means we â€‹have made it our mission to only do good work for good organizations and projects.</p>
<p>Because of this, we design and develop websites, apps, technology, and software for organizations that strive to make the world a better, more awesome, place for everyone.</p>
<p>For larger projects, companies, and organizations we only charge what is needed. Nothing more. <a href="/contact">Contact us to get a quote!</a>
<h2>Free Work</h2>
<p>Because we strive to make the world a better place we also do <strong>free</strong> professional development and design for smaller nonprofit organizations. Are you a nonprofit? <a href="/contact.html">Email us!</a>

<h2>Referral System</h2>
<p>We also offer a referral system! What is that? Well, for every person you refer to us, you will receive either $25 and/or 3% commision cut from the final cost we charge to the company/organization! That's basically just free money!</p>
